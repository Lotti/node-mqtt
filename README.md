# node-mqtt

The server is composed by a REST API server and an MQTT broker. At this time the MQTT broker is working on WebSocket instead of a dedicated port.

You can reach the server here: https://node-mqtt.eu-gb.bluemix.net/ with MQTT over websocket


You can also run locally the server by using these commands.

start the server with 
```
npm start
```

run tests suite with
```
npm test
```

Keep in mind that node v6.1.0 was used to develop this software.
